%%--------------------------------------------------------------------
%% @doc
%% This function is called whenever an application is started using
%% application:start/[1,2], and should start the processes of the
%% application. If the application is structured according to the OTP
%% design principles as a supervision tree, this means starting the
%% top supervisor of the tree.

%%                                      {ok, Pid, State} |
%%                                      {error, Reason}

%%--------------------------------------------------------------------
%% @doc
%% This function is called whenever an application has stopped. It
%% is intended to be the opposite of Module:start/2 and should do
%% any necessary cleaning up. The return value is ignored.
